## General Information
- This model can help the management understand how the demand for shared bikes changes with different features and adjust their business strategy accordingly as they have experienced a significant decrease in their revenues due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. As a result, they are struggling to maintain their business in the current market conditions.
- The idea is to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and the model can also provide insight into the demand dynamics of a new market.
- US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes dataset has been used to develop the model.


## Conclusions
- Based on the conclusion 1 Spring season has the lowest demand when compared with other 3 seasons.
- There is no much of demand difference in weekdays and weekends.
- There is a steep increase of bike demand in year 2019 when compared with 2018.
- The factors which was affecting the demand are temperature and seasons.



## Technologies Used
